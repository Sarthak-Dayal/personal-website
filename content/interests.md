robots:

- [E.S.T.H.E.R](https://core-robotics-lab.github.io/Wheelchair-Tennis-Robot/): an exciting wheelchair tennis robot with tremendous capabilities in both perception and action

- [Firebot](https://www.paradigmrobotics.tech/firebot): the first robot i worked with at UT that has capabilities to allow it to provide useful information for firefighters during fires

- [The Miroka√Ø](https://enchanted.tools/robot/): an emotive robot that can maneuver in tight spaces that i interacted with at [SXSW 2023](https://www.sxsw.com/)

- [Intuitive DaVinci](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/products-and-services/da-vinci): a precise surgical robot family whose capabilities to make medicine safer excite me

- [AirHockey UR5e](https://rlairhockey.github.io/): the robot and air hockey setup that serves as my research home

- [The Building-wide-intelligence bot](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/#:~:text=Building%2DWide%20Intelligence%20Project&text=The%20mission%20the%20Building%2DWide,part%20of%20a%20building's%20environment.): the first robot i ever worked with on a formal research project

games:

- [Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker): one of the most exciting imperfect information games explored by [several papers](https://github.com/Sarthak-Dayal/poker-papers/tree/main)

- [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego): as seen in a [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15378) by DeepMind, this is a really fun imperfect information strategy game

- [Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan): a classic game that my friend group and i have become obsessed with. i hope to build an agent that can beat my friends in the near future :)

- [Ludo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan): a classic indian board game that has roots in [ancient indian literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo#:~:text=The%20origin%20of%20Ludo%20is,the%20Pandavas%20and%20the%20Kauravas.)
