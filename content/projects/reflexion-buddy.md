## Reflexion Buddy - The AI Journaling Companion

Reflexion Buddy is an AI-based journaling partner bringing increased enjoyment and accessibility to the journaling process. Our project is designed to empower individuals to embrace the benefits of reflection through journaling consistently. 

We believe that taking time to reflect is a powerful tool for enhancing mental well-being and personal growth, which is an approach backed by science and used by countless successful people who attribute journaling to their success, productivity, and overall well-being.

We built Reflexion Buddy using six essential AI components: 
- IBM Speech to Text for effortless voice-to-text transcription 
- GPT-4 Chat for engaging conversational capabilities
- GPT-4 Summarize for insightful content condensation
- DALL-E Stable Diffusion for generating meaningful visual representations
- Google Text-to-Speech for interactive communication
- IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding for sentiment analysis, allowing users to track their emotions over time

These six components come together to create a journaling system that allows you to maximize your overall well being by making the journaling process more enjoyable and gathering data on how your emotions are progressing.
