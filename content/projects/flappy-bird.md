## Flappy Bird Neuroevolution

I built a simple system that learned to play [flappy bird via neuroevolution](https://sarthak-dayal.github.io/Flappy-Bird-Neuro-Evolution/)!


Inspired by Daniel Schiffman, I built a simple matrix library, on top of which I built a machine learning and genetic algorithms library (all in Javascript, specifically p5.js because I didn’t know how else to interface with websites back then).

This project was later presented at App Dev League’s [Appathon](https://appathon.appdevleague.org/) and after my presentation I worked with App Dev League for a few years to bring STEM education to Title I schools around the world, and especially in Texas.

This was one of my first AI projects, and I had a lot of fun building it because of the visual component.
