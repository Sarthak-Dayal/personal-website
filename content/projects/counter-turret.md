## Counter A&M (C-AAM) Turret


In 24 hours, we built an auto-aiming robot that targeted A&M students and won HackTX 2023!

For our project, we designed a functional 2-axis turret with several control capabilities:

- Automatic Color Tracking (Via OpenCV)
- Speech Control (Via HAM Radio)
- Keyboard Control (Via USB Input)

Featuring innovation in radio, mechanical, electrical, and AI Engineering. As a group of four, we each focused on one of these topics.

We were inspired by the CRAM (Counter Rocket Artillery and Missile) system largely used in military applications and wanted to bring a 2 axis turret platform to the non-military world for multi-purpose applications.

We captured the full story of how we built this in [this photos album](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO2ZUEabdTDqE61_cXa_whHBsWGtahYJb0-R4R9buSMHx8EpsttLtMs4er47ZNUug?key=R0hrOTlXN0drREExREUzTWswc2FlR1pRcmZhQlB3)
