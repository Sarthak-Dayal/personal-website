## Update Bot

As my first ever public project on [Github](https://github.com/Sarthak-Dayal/Update-Bot), Update Bot is close to my heart. I built Update Bot in high school for a Discord Server that my friend and I ran with over 500 people, because we wanted a way to get daily news updates filtered to our preferences; no such bot existed back then.

Using the News API, sqlite, and Discordâ€™s API, I built a bot with many features that served as the life of our Discord server.
