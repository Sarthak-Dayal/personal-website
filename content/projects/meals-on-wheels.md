Meals on Wheels x NUEVA Delivery App

<img src="/images/mow0.png" alt="Meals On Wheels Logo" width=300px>

Meals on Wheels and Project NUEVA from Texas Tech teamed up to help serve the elderly with their nutrition needs. As part of my work with Texas Convergent, I helped build a delivery application to assist volunteers at Meals on Wheels complete deliveries to their clients. This application will pair with the NUEVA application for the elderly to help with their nutrition needs.

The app consisted of the following features:

- Meal pickup and clients list: Volunteers can easily check the amount and type of meals they need to pick up from the Meals on Wheels Austin distribution center. The volunteers can also see the route of addresses, people, etc. that they need to drop off food at.

- Route to clients in app: Volunteers can also easily find routes to any of the addresses they see on the route list in the app with an integrated map using the Google Maps API. The routes also contain any special notes and contact information for clients.

- Wellness check surveys and status updates: Volunteers fill out a wellness check survey to record to whom the delivery was handed off to and the status of the client after each delivery. If, for any reason, a volunteer is unable to complete a request, they can indicate that as well are report the reason for the incomplete request.

We were able to complete this app with all requested features, which was set to be released in early 2024.
