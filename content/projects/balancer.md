## Balancer - a three-stage inverted pendulum for RL experimentation

Inspired by a student in my reading group, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5GvwWKkBmg), and [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623017025?casa_token=H-xqPL6XoWEAAAAA:Ia5_QfBlNpgxn7pW5l1P6Hov1XeEfBnXqjjMvGEBSyf3D_k9bRKGxMF0LE0WF3YgJeU2DPm_), I decided to build my own three-stage inverted pendulum system to experiment with different RL algorithms. The plan is to be able to build a system that can run a force controller and then use RL to actually perform the task of lifting all three stages up and keeping them up for as long as possible. I plan on using some of the algorithms I have developed at the lab and testing them out on this system.

Right now, I am planning out how to build the physical frame and mechanical components of the robot, with a lot of help from Karmanyaah Malhotra and others at UT Austin.
