In 24 hours, we built [Takeover Texas](https://devpost.com/software/takeover-texas), a week-long game playable across the UT campus. Players are split into Red and Blue teams, typically 5-10 players each. Players can claim buildings by spending time in them (with location tracking on their phone). The team with more total time in a building owns the building or landmark. The live board displays the areas and has an LED that indicates who owns each area. This acts as a situation room display for players to see.

We were initially inspired by the concept of 3D printing a cityscape using Blender done by Dhilan Nag. Additionally, when combined with the combined concept of [traintrackr](https://www.traintrackr.io/product/mta3) of real-time tracking of trains using LEDs, we wanted to track our friends on a map of UT. Lastly, for the game itself, we were inspired by the YouTube series Jet Lag by Wendover Productions and adapted their game model from Jet Lag: Australia where they used territory control with wagering to just use time spent to make it simpler.
