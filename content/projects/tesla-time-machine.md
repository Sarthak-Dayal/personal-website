## Tesla Time Machine

<img src="/images/tesla0.png" alt="The time machine portal" width=300px>

This project didn’t go exactly as planned…

But we were still proud of the final result! In an attempt to build a system that could play music and communicate as Nikola Tesla using [Tesla coils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqs8bRMhBgA), we pivoted to a simple TV-based system when our original Tesla Coil idea didn’t pan out.

In the end, we designed an interactive and mechanical version of Nikola Tesla with several features including:

- Tesla Coil inspired distorted voice custom audio output
- LLM-based replication of Nikola Tesla's personality
- An easy to use speech-based interface and user-friendly visual design

featuring innovation in electronics and AI engineering.
